    - This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce
      the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain
      mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.

    descr: Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect
      you, even though it isn't a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the
      most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk's garments, or wizard's
      robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For
      more information on explorer's clothing, see pages 275--76.

      a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. On a success, your hook
      has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold
      but actually falls when you're partway up.

    descr: These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature's feet.
      You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact
      action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC
      14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage.
      A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a 5-foot penalty
      to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces
      the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough
      caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe. Deployed
      caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise,
      enough caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.

    descr: You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an
      exploration activity taking 10--30 seconds depending on the creature's size
      and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes
      a 15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with
      its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate
      action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly
      the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is
      immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what
      effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires
      two successful DC 17 Thievery checks.

      exploration activity taking 10--30 seconds depending on the creature's size
      and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes
      a -15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with
      its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate
      action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly
      the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is
      immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what
      effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from superior manacles require
      six successes at DC 42.
