      of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured

    - Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that
      his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon
      that would be such a symbol.
    - 'Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved,
      the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid
      of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools:
      the {@italic Brutal Pick}, the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, the {@italic Anvil
      of Songs}, and the {@italic Shaping Hammer}. With them, he forged the {@italic
      Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}.'
    - Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought
      peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies,
      and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young
      dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon,
      which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed
      the axe on for many generations.
    - Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in
      a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed.
      Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers

        for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in
        the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's

        Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can
        have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped
        organs-into separate piles.

    - Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons
      collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters
      carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon
      scale mail is highly valued. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
      AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath

        to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.
    - name: Personality
      type: entries
      entries:
      - Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.
      - The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats,
        including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang
        from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is
        meant to hurry that process along.
      - Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to {@item Wave} and
        {@item Whelm}, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It
        wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat,
        even though it violently disagrees with {@item Whelm} and finds {@item Wave}
        tedious.
      - Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three
        days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder
        occurs at the next sunset.

    - 'Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries
      before the arrival of {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}. Although he was very
      much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the
      day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground.
      In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear,
      a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its
      wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.'
    - When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target
      to 0 hit points, you gain {@dice 2d6} temporary hit points.
    - Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character {@adventure chosen
      by Kavan|CoS|14|Blood Spear of Kavan} to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack

      against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed
      their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely
      forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged
      against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the
      wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook
      during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for
      future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it
      reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's

        If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed,
        its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal.
        This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv.
        The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's
        name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever
        banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through
        the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which
        the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

      if the fortress is empty.
    - The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow
      slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two
      floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends
      at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door
      on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak
      as a bonus action. It is immune to the {@spell knock} spell and similar magic,
      such as that of a {@item chime of opening}.
    - Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity
      saving throw, taking {@dice 10d10} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half
      as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to
      an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that
      aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.
    - The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped
      over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to
      damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all
      other damage. Only a {@spell wish} spell can repair the fortress (this use of
      the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting
      of {@spell wish} causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

    - Stored in a leather pouch, this unique deck contains twenty-two colored cards
      made of some strong but unknown metal, each of which features a design printed
      as a mosaic of raised dots. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many
      cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered
      deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this
      number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck,
      its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the
      previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of
      cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.
    - Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or
      the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same
      card twice.

    entries:
    - A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an
      elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of
      orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation
      orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth
      of special components, which are consumed.
    - A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has
      a solid outer shell. The orb detonates {@dice 1d100} hours after its creation,
      releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of
      how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as {@spell identify}
      and {@spell divination} can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode.
      An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
      Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.
    - A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent
      it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's
      opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used
      to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the
      container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time
      when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes {@dice 1d6} rounds later, unless
      it is returned to the container.
    - Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with

      after one use.

      isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most
      dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be
      found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria
      and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects
      of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned}
      in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to
      0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead.
      A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased
      through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the
      duration or the price might vary accordingly.

      mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever
      coming about.
    - '{@creature Orcus|MTF}, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that
      would allow him to live on as a {@creature lich}. Beyond death, he became the
      greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed,
      Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his
      temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One,
      the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted
      Tower.'
    - Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself,
      or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever
      the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle
      that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one
      hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's
      will in the world.
    - The Eye of Vecna and the {@item Hand of Vecna} might be found together or separately.
      The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is
      a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
    - To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact
      into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there
      until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit
      for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
    - To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the
      press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and
      becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

        it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.
      - The goat of terror becomes a {@creature giant goat} for up to 3 hours. The
        goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One
        horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a
        horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when
        the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius
        aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts
        its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition
        frightened} of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine
        form. The {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once
        it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's

    - Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his
      time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest,
      he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own
      mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever
      coming about.
    - '{@creature Orcus|MTF}, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that
      would allow him to live on as a {@creature lich}. Beyond death, he became the
      greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed,
      Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his
      temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One,
      the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted
      Tower.'
    - Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself,
      or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever
      the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle
      that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one
      hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's
      will in the world.
    - The {@item Eye of Vecna} and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately.
      The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is
      a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
    - To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact
      into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there
      until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit
      for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
    - To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the
      press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and
      becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

    - When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring
      that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The
      trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a
      spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed
      on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take {@dice 1d4} piercing damage and stop
      moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement
      is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can
      use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
      within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to
      the trapped creature.

          leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered
          the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted
          realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains
          and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors.
          Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks
          and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the
          endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.
        - A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani
          in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von
          Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness
          and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people
          in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and
          Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures
          of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we
          must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."
        - Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only

      into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of
      unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned
      dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of
      cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can
      control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.
    - Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring
      to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly
      related device known as the {@i Machine of Lum the Mad}. The best details on

        easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.
      - Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part
        of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting
        with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature
        or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance
        of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once
        during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature

          its stat block or some other action.
        - When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can
          use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack
          against that creature.

        move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once
        every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while
        uncrewed.
      - If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned
        to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed}
        for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on
        a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned
        creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the
        artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.

      name: Self-Destruct
      entries:
      - By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's
        two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed
        to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered
        (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside
        the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the
        command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though,
        the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members
        against each other.
      - If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third
        round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered
        on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
        a creature takes 87 ({@damage 25d6}) force damage, 87 ({@damage 25d6}) lightning
        damage, and 87 ({@damage 25d6}) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature
        takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple
        damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind
        no remains.

        of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times
        the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.

    - When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images
      of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points,
      and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced
      to 0 hit points.
    - If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of
      it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains
      activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.
    - Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror
      while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or
      be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's
      twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the
      creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw
      automatically.
    - An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces
      visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and
      they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can
      escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined
      to the cell until freed.
    - If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already
      occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the
      new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of
      the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures
      it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
    - While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of
      one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature
      named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface.
      You and the creature can then communicate normally.
    - In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free
      one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its
      possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from
      it.

    - Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League
      engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they
      have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus
      is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates,
      bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium,
      all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.
    - While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus.
      In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared.
      The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which
      you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.
    - You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it
      you must make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The DC is 10 + twice
      the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.
    - On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC
      and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell
      from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling
      on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th
      level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.
    - If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

    entries:
    - Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously
      guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed
      one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their
      magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with
      their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.
    - A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and
      remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can
      claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions
      like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.
    - A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires
      a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated
      to the elven gods.
    - A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at
      odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you
      make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24
      hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears
      on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is
      destroyed.
    - A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically
      {@dice 1d6 + 1}). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage
      rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon
      blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it
      randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

          of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.'
      - - 95-96
        - You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each

          A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
          ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again
          until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.

          except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create
          new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves.
          It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.

      - The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation
        through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.
        It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder
        is either in a trance or asleep.

      - The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has
        bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.
      - If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an
        owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner
        falls short of elven ideals.

    entries:
    - Typically found in {@dice 1d4} pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing
      1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects
      by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the
      desired object as you concentrate on its image.
    - "Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which\
      \ lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features\u2014such as a door,\
      \ a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014that are up to 10,000\
      \ cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet."
    - When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes
      a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual
      door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates
      a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.
    - Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you
      paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the
      object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste,
      bone, or some other worthless material.
    - If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears
      but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

    - Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash
      the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to
      20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature
      or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is
      covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after
      1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil.
      You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area,
      provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals
      5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.
      A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

    - Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against
      evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High
      Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of
      Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken
      to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward
      a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed
      the dragons with powerful magic.
    - As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or
      faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been
      warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of
      calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over
      dragons.
    - Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any
      attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find
      themselves enslaved to an orb.
    - An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it
      grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
    - While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths
      and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a
      successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

      you remain attuned to it.

      attunement to it, and the orb casts {@spell suggestion} on you at will (save
      DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence
      within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people,
      freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship
      of Takhisis ({@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat''s} name on Krynn), or something else

        lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button
        again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.
      - If you press button 1, the rod becomes a {@item flame tongue} as a fiery blade
        sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type
        of sword).
      - If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped
        blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants
        a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
      - If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs
        from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming
        the rod into a magic spear that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
        made with it.
      - If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet
        long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom
        and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long
        fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear
        up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod
        to revert to its normal form.
      - If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and
        grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors,
        barricades, and other barriers.
      - If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates
        magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a
        location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of
        your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

      - The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with

      - The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner
        can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to
        engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation
        of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before.

      If it scores one or more hits against a {@creature vampire} or a {@creature
      vampire spawn} in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into
      dust once the battle concludes.
    - As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord
      soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer
      and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil
      to stand before her.
    - Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation
      into a {@creature vampire} did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her
      followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of
      {@creature vampire spawn} to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed
      to a one.
    - Suffused with confidence born of a righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle
      Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end,
      Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a
      limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath
      his castle, and her remains linger there yet.
    - The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest
      of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts
      grievous injury on the undead.
    - '{@item Mace of Disruption}. When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic
      weapon, that creature takes an extra {@dice 2d6} radiant damage. If the target

      light for an additional 20 feet.

    - The amulet is a 4-inch-wide disk composed of silver-framed wood, with a rune
      carved into its face. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals a magical aura of
      enchantment around the amulet.
    - Every {@creature shield guardian} has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield
      guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed,
      the shield guardian is {@condition incapacitated} until a replacement amulet
      is created.
    - A shield guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn
      or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic
      damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.
    - A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's
      wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder
      against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can
      magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.
    - A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the
      shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane
      of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate
      the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian
      are within 10 feet of each other.

          24, as well as hearing and {@sense truesight} out to a range of 120 feet.
        - The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can
          communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet
          of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.
        - The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast
          {@spell fireball} or 2 charges to cast {@spell wall of fire} from the shield
          (save DC 21 for each). The {@spell wall of fire} spell lasts for 1 minute
          (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily
          at dawn.
        - Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread
          for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any
          creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield
          must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
          {@condition frightened} until the start of its next turn. On a successful
          save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24

        It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy
        prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever
        bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.
      - While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current
        owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn
        the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner
        does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its
        prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to
        find it.
      - Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes
        (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the
        Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.

        the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released,
        Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.

      iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal
      writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because
      each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature

      entries:
      - Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped
        within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts
        from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels
        to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to
        its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from
        soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as {@creature lemure} devils.
      - A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin
        has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all
        damage except that which is dealt by a {@item hellfire weapon|bgdia} or an
        infernal war machine's furnace (see "{@adventure Soul Fuel|bgdia|11|Soul Fuel}").
      - Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul
        belongs to an evil creature.

        the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.
      - Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third
        layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil
        mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout
        the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains,
        and bribes.

      it, that target takes an extra {@dice 1d8} radiant damage.
    - The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light
      for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists,
      you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light
      by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

    - This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders,
      neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half
      plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other
      kinds of armor.
    - A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment
      (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases
      (such as those created by a {@spell cloudkill} spell, a {@spell stinking cloud}
      spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

    - 'When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas
      the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain
      served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna''s
      admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would
      wield it.'
    - For a long time, Kas faithfully served the {@creature lich} but as Kas's power
      grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they
      could rule the {@creature lich||lich's} empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says
      Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious
      lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter
      thereby.
    - The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack
      and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20,
      and deals an extra {@dice 2d10} slashing damage to undead.
    - If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard,
      its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the
      wielder takes {@dice 3d6} psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated
      by the sword, as if by the {@spell dominate monster} spell, and the sword demands
      that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is

      - The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and {@item

        check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within
        30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest,
        nothing happens, and the {@spell wish} spell is wasted. If the sword loses
        the contest, it is destroyed.

        it's used to shatter the Companion (see "{@adventure Shattering the Companion|bgdia|8|shattering
        the companion}"), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating
        15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.
      - If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the
        sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.

    name: The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad
    source: IMR
    page: 96
    rarity: artifact
    reqAttune: true
    wondrous: true
    bonusWeaponAttack: '+1'
    entries:
    - This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten
      and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient
      and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins
      derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal
      Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.
    - Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought
      it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later
      years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with
      its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical
      effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known
      as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his
      great machine was destroyed.
    - The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing
      some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty
      levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These
      controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.
    - type: entries
      name: Silver Wire
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing
        use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its
        attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from
        the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature
        as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to
        the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire
        becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite
        length.
      - "As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of\
        \ the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user.\
        \ If the wire is cut\u2014something that can happen only when an effect specifically\
        \ states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord\u2014\
        the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them\
        \ instantly."
      - Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated
        on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of
        14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.

      - 'When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability
        to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its

        school, as follows:'

    - type: entries
      name: Wish
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the
        proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell
        (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming,
        this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used,
        there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning,
        necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the
        expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs
        are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.
    - type: entries
      name: Random Properties
      entries:
      - "There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls\
        \ than can ever be known or matrixed\u2014especially as the controls shift\
        \ position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of\
        \ the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random\
        \ beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for\
        \ each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep\
        \ things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties,\
        \ revealing those properties only during the course of play."
      - Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long
        rest.

        \ catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery.\
        \ It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal\
        \ Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner\
        \ workings\u2014and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked.\
        \ Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine\
        \ to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space\
        \ and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again."

          point constantly in the direction of the named target. You gain no knowledge
          of the distance to the target.
        - A specialized clockwork compass floats in front of you, and points toward
          you. The DM determines whether a creature currently looking for you is drawn
          to your location. Additionally, when a creature attacks you for the first
          time during an encounter, it has advantage on the attack roll.
      - - '11'
        - Your clothes are wrapped in illusion that makes them appear to be the very

      The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out
      the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of
      undeath. {@creature Orcus|MTF} allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time
      to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity
      to achieve some fell goal.
    - Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged
      skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by {@creature Orcus|MTF}. The
      wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user.

        devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention

    name: Wyrmskull Throne

    recharge: dawn
    charges: 9
    entries:
    - "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven\
      \ empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages\
      \ untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made\
      \ of polished obsidian with oversized feet\u2014the impaled skulls of four ancient\
      \ blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue\
      \ energy when the throne's powers are activated."
    - After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less
      honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic
      elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the {@creature storm giant} Neri for
      a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to
      her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters
      of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea.
      Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness
      the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King
      Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's
      power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's
      leadership.
    - Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is {@condition
      paralyzed} and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature
      can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the
      force field dispels the field, though the creature remains {@condition paralyzed}
      until it is separated from the throne.
    - "Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic\u2014\
      the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although\
      \ powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master"
    - name: Properties of the Throne
      type: entries
      entries:
      - 'The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
        A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its
        possession can harness the throne''s properties, which are as follows:'
      - The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the
        creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.
      - Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and
        stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't
        expend any charges.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell lightning bolt}
        (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level
        spell slot and deals 49 ({@dice 14d6}) lightning damage. The bolt discharges
        from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the {@spell globe
        of invulnerability} spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature
        and the throne.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image
        of an {@creature ancient blue dragon} that surrounds both it and the throne.
        The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's
        turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against
        targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus,
        reach, and damage as an {@creature ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's}
        bite and claw attacks.
    - name: Destroying the Throne
      type: entries
      entries:
      - The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters
        of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung
        of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered
        with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on
        a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers
        an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature
        and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed
        on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@dice 20d6}) slashing damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
