# DND_dynamic_settelment
 Using previous tools to create a settlement, with fleshed out NPC's and changing economy
 
 
 the main focus of this tool is to create a dynamic town, this requires the following things
 
 Details of the town are readily available
 
 The structure of the town is fluid, pertaining to the power, status and health of NPC's and/or their family / clique
 
 The town is inhabbited by regualr npcs (numeric values) and notable npcs (actual characters)
 
 The town changes over time, each day, week or year depending on user input and includes the effects of resident hero's that use the town as a central base
 
 The town and its history is documented, along with previous NPC actions that affect modern day relations
 
 The town is exportable and can be read in a fancy pdf format or a simple yaml / json format

The way that NPC's are set out is by using the descriptors (eyes, hair, muscles ect) and each descriptor is given a value based on 
the outstandingness of it, general descriptions take 2-4 of these descriptors to describe the asthetic of the character,

Buildings and Locations follow a similar path, with certain descriptors (lots of green-ery, marble tiling, tapestries ect)
