      - A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is {@condition restrained} until
        it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures
        that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength
        check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing
        5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming
        it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus
        action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless
        of the number of attacks you can normally make.
