    - "An abracadabrus is an ornate, gemstone-studded wooden chest that weighs 25\
      \ pounds while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 1\xBD feet\
      \ on a side."
    - The chest has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch the closed lid
      of the chest and expend 1 of the chest's charges while naming one or more nonmagical
      objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of
      1 gp or less. The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they
      can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example,
      the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon
      of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured
      by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems
      and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.
    - The chest regains {@dice 1d20} expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's
      last charge is expended, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the chest loses its magic
      (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust.

      - The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to
        accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up
        to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

      entries:
      - The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while
        you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink
        it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle
        is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
        it.
      - The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle,
        you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force
        damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily
        at dawn.

      name: Perfect Tools

      - While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name
        of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth
        10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that
        material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish
        a short or long rest.
      - You can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item
        brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB},
        and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make
        using the artifact as one of these tools.

      - As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you
        can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your
        action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding
        the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful
        for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in
        the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's
        hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate.
        Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can
        have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped
        organs-into separate piles.

        creature.
      - You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific
        destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated
        destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and
        vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky,
        with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images
        of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination.

        came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels

      of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces
      of cut obsidian.
    - You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
      It has the following additional properties.
    - name: Devour Soul
      type: entries
      entries:
      - Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays
        the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature
        whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by
        a {@spell wish} spell.
      - When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to
        the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours.
        As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand,
        you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
      - If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take {@dice 1d10} necrotic damage
        and the target regains {@dice 1d10} hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces
        you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul.

      - While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger
        creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also
        can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}.
      - Blackrazor can cast the {@spell haste} spell on you once per day. It decides
        when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't
        have to.
    - name: Sentience
      type: entries
      entries:
      - Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17,
        a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision}
        out to a range of 120 feet.
      - The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with
        its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned
        to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.
    - name: Personality
      type: entries
      entries:
      - Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.
      - The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats,
        including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang
        from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is
        meant to hurry that process along.
      - Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to {@item Wave} and
        {@item Whelm}, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It
        wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat,
        even though it violently disagrees with {@item Whelm} and finds {@item Wave}
        tedious.
      - Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three
        days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder
        occurs at the next sunset.

    rarity: artifact
    reqAttune: by a creature of good alignment
    wondrous: true
    weight: 5
    entries:
    - The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book
      of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a
      scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the
      pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating
      evil.
    - The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is
      read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance
      can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy
      the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the
      benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.
    - A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure.
      Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the
      clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must
      spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain
      its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the
      text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that
      tries to read from the book takes {@dice 24d6} radiant damage. This damage ignores
      resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature
      reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is
      destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.
    - Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive
      to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity
      within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose
      all the benefits granted by the book.

    entries:
    - The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and
      drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it
      contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites
      madness.
    - Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded
      in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example
      of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic
      he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.
    - Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to
      its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of
      later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases,
      made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages
      are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that
      the original text can't be divined.
    - Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence,
      animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever
      it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long
      enough.
    - A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to
      digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify
      the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand
      the lore already contained within.
    - Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature
      must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment
      changes to neutral evil.
    - The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work
      evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span
      of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If
      you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul.
      You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

        wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some

        when a new author adds pages to the tome.
      - If a {@creature solar} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice
        1d100} years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.
      - "A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase\

      forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged
      against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the
      wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook
      during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for
      future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it

        spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic.
        If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed,
        its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal.
        This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv.
        The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's
        name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever
        banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through
        the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which
        the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

      entries:
      - The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount
        Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to
        make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his
        first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The
        Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed
        in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

      saving throw or begin a comic dance that lasts for 1 minute. Humanoids that

      have advantage on attack rolls against it. Each time it takes damage, the dancer
      can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. When

    - Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of
      ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards,
      but the rest have twenty-two.
    - Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and
      then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate
      the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise,
      as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw
      each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the
      chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own
      and take effect all at once.
    - Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or
      the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same
      card twice.

      entries:
      - Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity
        of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character
        should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking
        out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash
        with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront
        the devil itself.
    - In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone
      thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a
      dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer
      guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.

        during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect
        of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character
        to operate in a robotic state until freed.

    - An {@italic Ioun stone} is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy
      revered on some worlds. Many types of {@italic Ioun stone} exist, each type
      a distinct combination of shape and color.
    - When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits
      your head at a distance of {@dice 1d3} feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter,
      another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it
      from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful
      DC 24 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. You can use an action to seize
      and stow the stone, ending its effect.
    - A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered
      to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.
    - You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

    - This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's
      command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If
      the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the
      target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask.
      If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the
      saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released.
      The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask
      doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.
    - You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature
      the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for
      1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or
      give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but
      otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in
      accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
    - An {@spell identify} spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but
      the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly
      discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined
      randomly.

        name: Mother Luba and the Vistani
        entries:
        - The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential
          leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered
          the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted
          realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains
          and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors.
          Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks
          and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the
          endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.
        - A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani
          in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von
          Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness
          and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people
          in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and
          Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures
          of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we
          must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."
        - Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only
          the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it,
          you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.

    entries:
    - Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the {@creature Mighty Servant
      of Leuk-o|TCE} is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns
      into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of
      unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned
      dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of
      cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can
      control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.
    - Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring
      to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly
      related device known as the {@i Machine of Lum the Mad}. The best details on
      the device's origins and operation can be found in the {@i Mind of Metal}, a
      tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the
      lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over
      granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled
      Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.

      - The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is
        easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.
      - Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part
        of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting
        with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature
        or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance
        of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once
        during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature
        attunes itself to the artifact.

        tools|PHB}. A {@spell knock} spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the
        start of the caster's next turn.
      - A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement.
        Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside
        it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.
      - 'While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls.

          its stat block or some other action.
        - When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can
          use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack
          against that creature.

      - Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact

        move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once
        every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while
        uncrewed.
      - If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned
        to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed}
        for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on
        a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned
        creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the
        artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.

      name: Self-Destruct
      entries:
      - By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's
        two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed
        to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered
        (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside
        the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the
        command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though,
        the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members
        against each other.
      - If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third
        round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered
        on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,

        disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its

    wondrous: true

    entries:
    - When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images
      of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points,
      and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced
      to 0 hit points.
    - If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of
      it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains
      activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.
    - Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror
      while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or
      be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's
      twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the
      creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw
      automatically.
    - An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces
      visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and
      they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can
      escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined
      to the cell until freed.
    - If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already
      occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the
      new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of
      the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures
      it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
    - While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of
      one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature
      named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface.
      You and the creature can then communicate normally.
    - In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free
      one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its
      possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from
      it.

    - Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League
      engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they
      have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus
      is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates,
      bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium,
      all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.
    - While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus.
      In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared.
      The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which
      you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.
    - You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it
      you must make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The DC is 10 + twice
      the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.
    - On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC
      and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell
      from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling
      on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th
      level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.
    - If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

    - Every {@creature shield guardian} has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield
      guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed,
      the shield guardian is {@condition incapacitated} until a replacement amulet
      is created.
    - A shield guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn
      or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic
      damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.
    - A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's
      wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder
      against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can
      magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.
    - A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the
      shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane
      of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate
      the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian
      are within 10 feet of each other.

    - This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found,
      roll a {@dice d6} and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in
      the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling
      blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.
    - When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level
      into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to
      be stored in the bottle.
    - While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses
      the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability
      of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The
      bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.
    - If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within
      60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt
      the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell
      has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th
      level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's
      level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.

    - This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar
      to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that's no more than
      320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information.
      When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken
      to access the information stored within.
    - While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard,
      seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing
      new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating
      on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write
      normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section
      in the shard that addresses it.
    - A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and
      time to "scribe" a spell into the shard.

        telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand

      - Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon
        strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better
        ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests
        around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielder's goals run counter
        to its own, Tearulai attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain,
        whereupon it can use its {@spell transport via plants} spell to return whence
        it came.
    - When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon
      damage dice against the target.
    - When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll,
      that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another {@dice d20}.
      If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of
      such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop
      off a portion of its body instead.
    - '{@i Note: According to the SRD, it is an extra {@dice 4d6} slashing damage,
      although {@link this is incorrect|https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/949111823990534144}}.'
    - In addition, you can speak the sword's command to cause the blade to shed bright
      light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking
      the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

      boards of white pine and sealed with a clasp and lock of tarnished silver. The
      book is cold to the touch, and the fur is worn about the edges from use. The

      first page is a title page with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining
      pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled

    entries:
    - This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten
      and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient
      and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins
      derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal
      Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.
    - Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought
      it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later
      years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with
      its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical
      effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known
      as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his
      great machine was destroyed.
    - The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing
      some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty
      levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These
      controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.
    - type: entries
      name: Silver Wire
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing
        use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its
        attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from
        the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature
        as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to
        the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire
        becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite
        length.
      - "As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of\
        \ the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user.\
        \ If the wire is cut\u2014something that can happen only when an effect specifically\
        \ states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord\u2014\
        the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them\
        \ instantly."
      - Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated
        on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of
        14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.

        this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used,
        there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning,
        necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the
        expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs
        are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.

        - A specialized clockwork compass floats in front of you, and points toward

    - This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front
      cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original.
      The grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged
      to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The
      tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters
      who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable
      scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.
    - If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane
      focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast
      a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using
      any verbal or somatic component. Once used, this property of the tome can't
      be used again until the next dawn.
    - While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover.
      If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.
    - Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in
      the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.

    - Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these
      lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum),

      created by a {@spell cloudkill} spell, a {@spell stinking cloud} spell, inhaled

      The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out
      the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of
      undeath. {@creature Orcus|MTF} allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time

      to achieve some fell goal.
    - Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged
      skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by {@creature Orcus|MTF}. The

    - "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven\
      \ empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages\
      \ untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made\
      \ of polished obsidian with oversized feet\u2014the impaled skulls of four ancient\
      \ blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue\
      \ energy when the throne's powers are activated."
    - After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less
      honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic
      elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the {@creature storm giant} Neri for
      a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to
      her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters
      of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea.
      Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness
      the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King
      Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's
      power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's
      leadership.
    - Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is {@condition
      paralyzed} and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature
      can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the
      force field dispels the field, though the creature remains {@condition paralyzed}
      until it is separated from the throne.
    - "Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic\u2014\
      the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although\
      \ powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master"

      - 'The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
        A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its
        possession can harness the throne''s properties, which are as follows:'
      - The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the
        creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.
      - Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and
        stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't
        expend any charges.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell lightning bolt}
        (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level
        spell slot and deals 49 ({@dice 14d6}) lightning damage. The bolt discharges
        from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the {@spell globe
        of invulnerability} spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature
        and the throne.
      - As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image
        of an {@creature ancient blue dragon} that surrounds both it and the throne.
        The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's
        turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against
        targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus,
        reach, and damage as an {@creature ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's}
        bite and claw attacks.
    - name: Destroying the Throne
      type: entries
      entries:
      - The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters
        of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung
        of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered
        with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on
        a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers
        an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature
        and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed
        on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@dice 20d6}) slashing damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
