    - This ordinary bag, made from tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag,
      however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
    - You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up
      to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine
      by rolling a {@dice d8} and consulting the table. The creature vanishes at the
      next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
    - The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn.
      You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action
      it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your
      enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate
      to its nature.
    - Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used
      again until the next dawn.

    - This scale bears celestial symbols on one pan and fiendish symbols on the other.
      You can use the scale to cast {@spell detect evil and good} as a ritual. Doing
      so requires you to place the scale on a solid surface, then sprinkle the pans
      with holy water or place a transparent gem worth 100 gp in each pan. The scale
      remains motionless if it detects nothing, tips to one side or the other for
      good (consecrated) or evil (desecrated), and fluctuates slightly if it detects
      a creature appropriate to the spell but neither good nor evil. By touching the
      scales after casting the ritual, you instantly learn any information the spell
      can normally convey, and then the effect ends.

    - Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive
      stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability
      or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The
      drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't
      something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely
      to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts
      a {@spell fireball} in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood
      are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}
      table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.

      color when held up in the light.

      can hurl the grenade up to 120 feet. At the end of their turn, the grenade explodes.

      - Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire

        it takes 28 (8d6) thunder damage and is {@condition stunned} until the end

        and is not {@condition stunned}.
      - The wielder rolls on the chart* for the {@item wand of wonder|dmg} three times,
        rerolling any duplicate results. Any effects that specify a target affect
        all creatures in range of the grenade when it explodes. Any effects that would
        affect the wielder of the wand instead affect the closest creature to the
        grenade when it goes off.
    - The grenade explodes immediately if a creature places it in an extradimensional
      space or teleports while in possession of it. The effects of the explosion will
      be felt at both the origin and terminus of the teleportation, but only affecting
      all creatures within 30 feet of either location.

    - This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an
      extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material,
      not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up
      to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds,
      regardless of its contents.
    - Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting
      with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action.
      When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically
      on top.
    - The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object
      pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack
      is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns
      up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill
      forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.
      If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive
      for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
    - Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item bag
      of holding}, {@item portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both
      items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one
      item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is
      sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The
      gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

      is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates,

    - While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus.

      The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which
      you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.
    - You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it
      you must make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The DC is 10 + twice
      the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.
    - On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC
      and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell
      from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling
      on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th
      level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.
    - If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

    - You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a
      solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole
      10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane,
      so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable
      hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
    - You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of
      the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures
      or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in
      it, the hole weighs next to nothing.
    - If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space
      can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the
      creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or
      the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole

      of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
      Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

    wondrous: true
    entries:
    - The amulet is a 4-inch-wide disk composed of silver-framed wood, with a rune
      carved into its face. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals a magical aura of
      enchantment around the amulet.
    - Every {@creature shield guardian} has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield
      guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed,
      the shield guardian is {@condition incapacitated} until a replacement amulet
      is created.
    - A shield guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn
      or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic
      damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.
    - A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's
      wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder
      against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can
      magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.
    - A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the
      shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane
      of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate
      the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian
      are within 10 feet of each other.

    - Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull

      When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken
      to access the information stored within.
    - While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard,
      seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing
      new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating
      on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write
      normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section
      in the shard that addresses it.
    - A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and
      time to "scribe" a spell into the shard.

    - The Codicil of White is a tall, thin volume bound in white ermine fur over seasoned
      boards of white pine and sealed with a clasp and lock of tarnished silver. The
      book is cold to the touch, and the fur is worn about the edges from use. The
      twenty-seven pages within are of vellum painted with silver gilt on the outer
      edges. The whole is sewn to a leather binding with strips of sinews, making
      it quite durable.
    - A creature with the codicil in its possession has resistance to cold damage.
    - The codicil was written by followers of Auril as a primer on her worship. The
      first page is a title page with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining
      pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled
      among these descriptions is a spell that wizards can learn ({@spell frost fingers|IDRotF},

      by magic.
    - Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these
      lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum),
      and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those
      created by a {@spell cloudkill} spell, a {@spell stinking cloud} spell, inhaled
      poisons, and gaseous breath weapons.
    - As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had
      cast the {@spell gust of wind} spell (spell save DC 15) with no components.
      This property of the lungs can't be used again until the next dawn.

      a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll {@dice d100} and consult the
      following table to discover what happens.
    - If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC

      120 feet if it isn't already.
    - If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target.
      If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which
      ones are affected.

      the wand's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust
