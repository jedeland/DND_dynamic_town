      the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon
      of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured
      by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems

    - The amulet has 6 charges and regains {@dice 1d6} charges daily at dawn. While
      wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport
      yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet

    - Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that
      his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon
      that would be such a symbol.
    - 'Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved,
      the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid
      of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools:
      the {@italic Brutal Pick}, the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, the {@italic Anvil
      of Songs}, and the {@italic Shaping Hammer}. With them, he forged the {@italic
      Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}.'
    - Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought
      peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies,
      and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young
      dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon,
      which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed
      the axe on for many generations.
    - Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in
      a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed.
      Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers

        out to a range of 120 feet.
      - The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read,
        and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense

      - Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a
        law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The
        weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.
      - If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten
        times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger
        object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't
        be wielded. Nothing short of a {@spell wish} spell can separate the axe from
        the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other,
        though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.

        it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle
        is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
        it.
      - The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle,
        you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force
        damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily

        material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish
        a short or long rest.
      - You can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item

      - As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you
        can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your
        action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding
        the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful
        for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in
        the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's
        hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate.
        Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can
        have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped
        organs-into separate piles.

        destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated
        destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and
        vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky,
        with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images

      entries:
      - Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.
      - The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats,
        including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang
        from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is
        meant to hurry that process along.
      - Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to {@item Wave} and
        {@item Whelm}, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It
        wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat,
        even though it violently disagrees with {@item Whelm} and finds {@item Wave}
        tedious.
      - Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three
        days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder
        occurs at the next sunset.

      before the arrival of {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}. Although he was very
      much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the
      day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground.
      In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear,
      a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its

    wondrous: true
    weight: 5
    entries:
    - The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book
      of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a
      scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the
      pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating
      evil.
    - The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is
      read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance
      can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy
      the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the
      benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.
    - A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure.
      Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the
      clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must
      spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain
      its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the
      text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that
      tries to read from the book takes {@dice 24d6} radiant damage. This damage ignores
      resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature
      reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is
      destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.
    - Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive
      to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity
      within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose
      all the benefits granted by the book.

    wondrous: true
    weight: 5
    entries:
    - The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and
      drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it
      contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites
      madness.
    - Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded
      in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example
      of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic
      he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.
    - Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to
      its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of
      later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases,
      made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages
      are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that
      the original text can't be divined.
    - Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence,
      animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever
      it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long
      enough.
    - A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to
      digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify
      the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand
      the lore already contained within.
    - Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature
      must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment
      changes to neutral evil.
    - The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work
      evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span
      of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If
      you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul.
      You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

        when a new author adds pages to the tome.
      - If a {@creature solar} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice
        1d100} years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.
      - "A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase\
        \ hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken\

      a beast you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 17
      Charisma saving throw or have the bridle tie itself around its neck, then fall
      under your command as if subjected to the {@spell dominate beast} spell. Once
      the targeted is affected, you do not need to hold the other end of the bridle
      to command it. With a successful saving throw, the target becomes immune to

      forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged
      against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the
      wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook
      during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for
      future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it

        If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed,
        its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal.
        This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv.
        The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's
        name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever
        banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through
        the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which
        the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

        with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront
        the devil itself.
    - In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone
      thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a
      dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer
      guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.

    - Stored in a leather pouch, this unique deck contains twenty-two colored cards
      made of some strong but unknown metal, each of which features a design printed
      as a mosaic of raised dots. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many
      cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered
      deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this
      number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck,
      its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the
      previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of
      cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.
    - Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or
      the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same
      card twice.

      the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology
      in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities
      of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while
      sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain,
      ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged
      behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps
      the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be

    - The Draakhorn was a gift from {@creature Tiamat|RoT} in the war between dragons
      and giants. It was once the horn of her {@creature ancient red dragon} consort,
      Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the
      giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires
      two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature
      sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted
      with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic
      runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.
    - The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few
      miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary,
      for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific
      messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.
    - "Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built\

      \ the North."
    - Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins
      to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the
      enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against
      the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no
      farther toward the entry.
    - "For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence\u2014\
      because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily {@condition\
      \ deafened} and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates\
      \ the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates\
      \ the character remains {@condition deafened} for 1 hour after the Draakhorn\
      \ ceases to sound."
    - While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
      throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front
      of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27

      dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be

    entries:
    - Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his
      time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest,
      he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own
      mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever
      coming about.
    - '{@creature Orcus|MTF}, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that
      would allow him to live on as a {@creature lich}. Beyond death, he became the
      greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed,
      Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his
      temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One,
      the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted
      Tower.'
    - Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself,
      or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever
      the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle
      that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one
      hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's
      will in the world.
    - The Eye of Vecna and the {@item Hand of Vecna} might be found together or separately.
      The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is
      a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
    - To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact
      into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there
      until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit
      for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
    - To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the
      press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and
      becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

      or stow only one.
    - This armor also has six pockets, each of which is an extradimensional space.
      Each pocket can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of
      2 cubic feet. The armor always weighs 10 pounds, regardless of its pockets'
      contents. Placing an object into one of the armor's pockets follows the normal
      rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from a pocket of the
      armor requires you to use an action. When you reach into a pocket for a specific
      item, the item is always magically on top.
    - Placing the armor inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item bag of
      holding}, a {@item Heward's handy haversack}, or a similar item instantly destroys
      both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the
      one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate
      is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.
      The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

    - You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature
      the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for

      the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly

          the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted
          realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains
          and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors.
          Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks
          and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the
          endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.
        - A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani
          in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von
          Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness
          and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people
          in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and
          Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures
          of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we
          must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."
        - Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only
          the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it,
          you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.

      from any one mask. Additionally, you gain the Damage Absorption from each of

    entries:
    - Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the {@creature Mighty Servant
      of Leuk-o|TCE} is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns
      into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of
      unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned
      dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of
      cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can
      control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.
    - Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring
      to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly
      related device known as the {@i Machine of Lum the Mad}. The best details on
      the device's origins and operation can be found in the {@i Mind of Metal}, a
      tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the
      lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over
      granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled
      Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.

      entries:
      - Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature
        tries to attune to it, nothing happens.
      - The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is
        easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.
      - Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part
        of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting
        with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature
        or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance
        of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once
        during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature
        attunes itself to the artifact.
    - type: entries
      name: Controlling the Servant
      entries:
      - While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open
        the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch
        as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using {@item thieves'
        tools|PHB}. A {@spell knock} spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the
        start of the caster's next turn.
      - A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement.
        Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside
        it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.
      - 'While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls.
        During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the
        following ways:'
      - type: list
        items:
        - Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)
        - Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)
        - As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in
          its stat block or some other action.
        - When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can
          use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack
          against that creature.
      - While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.
    - type: entries
      name: Ghost in the Machine
      entries:
      - Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact
        and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or
        move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once
        every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while
        uncrewed.
      - If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned
        to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed}
        for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on
        a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned
        creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the
        artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.
    - type: entries
      name: Self-Destruct
      entries:
      - By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's
        two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed
        to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered
        (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside
        the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the
        command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though,
        the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members
        against each other.
      - If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third
        round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered
        on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
        a creature takes 87 ({@damage 25d6}) force damage, 87 ({@damage 25d6}) lightning
        damage, and 87 ({@damage 25d6}) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature
        takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple
        damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind
        no remains.
      - "This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, {@dice 2d6} days later,\
        \ its parts\u2014left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and\
        \ upper torso\u2014drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of\

      name: Destroying the Servant
      entries:
      - The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its
        disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its
        ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine
        of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times
        the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.

    entries:
    - When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images
      of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points,
      and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced
      to 0 hit points.
    - If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of
      it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains
      activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.
    - Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror
      while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or
      be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's
      twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the
      creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw
      automatically.
    - An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces
      visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and
      they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can
      escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined
      to the cell until freed.
    - If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already
      occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the
      new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of
      the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures
      it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
    - While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of
      one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature
      named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface.
      You and the creature can then communicate normally.
    - In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free
      one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its
      possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from
      it.

    - Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League
      engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they
      have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus
      is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates,
      bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium,
      all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.
    - While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus.
      In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared.
      The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which
      you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.
    - You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it
      you must make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The DC is 10 + twice
      the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.
    - On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC
      and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell
      from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling
      on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th
      level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.
    - If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence ({@skill
      Arcana}) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

    entries:
    - Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously
      guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed
      one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their
      magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with
      their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.
    - A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and
      remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can
      claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions
      like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.
    - A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires
      a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated
      to the elven gods.
    - A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at
      odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you
      make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24
      hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears
      on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is
      destroyed.
    - A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically
      {@dice 1d6 + 1}). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage
      rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon
      blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it
      randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

          A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,

      - The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation
        through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.
        It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder
        is either in a trance or asleep.

      - The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has
        bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.
      - If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an
        owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner
        falls short of elven ideals.

    - A navigation orb is a hollow, 7-foot-diameter sphere of thin, polished mithral
      with a large skye (cloud) rune embossed on its outer surface. The orb levitates
      10 feet above the ground and is keyed to a particular cloud castle, allowing
      you to control that castle's altitude and movement while the orb is inside the
      castle. If the orb is destroyed or removed from its castle, the castle's altitude
      and location remain fixed until the orb is returned or replaced.
    - 'As an action, you can cause one of the following effects to occur if you are
      touching the orb:'
    - The castle moves at a speed of 1 mph in a straight line, in a direction of your
      choice, until the castle stops or is made to stop, or until another action is
      used to change its direction. If this movement brings the castle into contact
      with the ground, the castle lands gently.
    - The castle, if it is moving, comes to a gradual stop.
    - The castle makes a slow, 90-degree turn clockwise or counterclockwise (turning
      a northerly view into a westerly view, for example). The castle can turn while
      it is moving in a straight line.
    - Any creature touching the orb knows the altitude of the base of the castle above
      the ground or water below it.

    - Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against
      evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High
      Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of
      Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken
      to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward
      a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed
      the dragons with powerful magic.
    - As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or
      faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been
      warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of
      calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over
      dragons.
    - Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any
      attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find
      themselves enslaved to an orb.
    - An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it
      grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
    - While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths
      and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a
      successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.
      On a failed check, you become {@condition charmed} by the orb for as long as
      you remain attuned to it.
    - 'While you are {@condition charmed} by the orb, you can''t voluntarily end your
      attunement to it, and the orb casts {@spell suggestion} on you at will (save
      DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence
      within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people,
      freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship
      of Takhisis ({@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat''s} name on Krynn), or something else

      Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended.
      As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and
      malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon
      its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds,
      including the Far Realm.
    - "To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components\

      The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear
      normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has
      no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession

    - This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a
      +3 bonus to attack and damage roll made with it. The rod has properties associated
      with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three
      other properties as well, detailed below.
    - name: Six Buttons
      type: entries
      entries:
      - You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect
        lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button
        again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.
      - If you press button 1, the rod becomes a {@item flame tongue} as a fiery blade
        sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type
        of sword).
      - If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped
        blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants
        a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
      - If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs
        from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming
        the rod into a magic spear that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
        made with it.
      - If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet
        long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom
        and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long
        fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear
        up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod
        to revert to its normal form.
      - If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and
        grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors,
        barricades, and other barriers.
      - If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates
        magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a
        location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of
        your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

      entries:
      - When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the

        points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again

      - The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with
        its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are

        but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.
      - The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner
        can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to
        engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation
        of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before.

          of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.
        - The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast
          {@spell fireball} or 2 charges to cast {@spell wall of fire} from the shield
          (save DC 21 for each). The {@spell wall of fire} spell lasts for 1 minute

      - While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current

        the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner
        does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its
        prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to
        find it.

      roll a {@dice d6} and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in
      the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling
      blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.
    - When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level
      into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to
      be stored in the bottle.
    - While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses
      the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability
      of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The
      bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.
    - If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within
      60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt
      the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell
      has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th
      level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's
      level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.

      When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken
      to access the information stored within.
    - While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard,
      seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing
      new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating
      on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write
      normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section

    entries:
    - This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space
      and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
    - The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes
      through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to
      damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed.
      Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated
      by it takes {@dice 4d10} force damage.
    - "The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet\
      \ of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence\
      \ ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction\
      \ of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 \xD7 your Intelligence modifier\
      \ (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature\
      \ whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw\
      \ or be touched by it, taking {@dice 4d10} force damage."
    - If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control,
      you make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check contested by the other creature's
      Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The winner of the contest gains control
      of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.
    - If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created
      by the {@spell gate} spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within
      a {@item portable hole}, the DM determines randomly what happens, using the
      following table.

          including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.

        cast the {@spell legend lore} spell.
      - By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the
        {@creature aboleth}, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't
        lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.
      - The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also
        knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon
        named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.

        out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature
        that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language.
        In addition, the {@creature aboleth} learns the greatest desires of any creature
        that communicates telepathically with the stone.
      - The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the
        clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner,
        it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible.
        If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see "Sentient

        Casting an {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the
        antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations.
        When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is
        destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30
        feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction,
        and it attacks all other creatures it can see.

    - Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's

      by the sword, as if by the {@spell dominate monster} spell, and the sword demands
      that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is

        Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth,
        and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your
        death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted
        at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total).
        If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of
        the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and
        you lose the implanted effect.

        of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others
        act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

    entries:
    - This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten
      and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient
      and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins
      derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal
      Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.
    - Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought
      it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later
      years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with
      its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical
      effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known
      as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his
      great machine was destroyed.
    - The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing
      some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty
      levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These
      controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.

      name: Silver Wire
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing
        use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its
        attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from
        the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature
        as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to
        the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire
        becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite
        length.
      - "As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of\
        \ the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user.\
        \ If the wire is cut\u2014something that can happen only when an effect specifically\
        \ states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord\u2014\
        the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them\
        \ instantly."
      - Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated
        on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of

      - The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the
        proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell
        (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming,
        this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used,
        there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning,
        necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the
        expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs
        are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.

      - "There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls\
        \ than can ever be known or matrixed\u2014especially as the controls shift\
        \ position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of\
        \ the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random\
        \ beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for\

        \ revealing those properties only during the course of play."
      - Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long

        \ It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal\

        \ workings\u2014and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked.\
        \ Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine\

    - This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front
      cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original.
      The grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged
      to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The
      tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters
      who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable
      scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.
    - If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane
      focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast
      a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using
      any verbal or somatic component. Once used, this property of the tome can't
      be used again until the next dawn.
    - While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover.
      If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.
    - Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in
      the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.

    - This book contains intuition and insight exercises, and its words are charged
      with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying
      the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Wisdom score increases
      by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic,
      but regains it in a century.

      The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out
      the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of
      undeath. {@creature Orcus|MTF} allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time
      to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity
      to achieve some fell goal.
    - Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged
      skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by {@creature Orcus|MTF}. The
      wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user.
      Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.

      must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature
      takes {@dice 10d6} necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and
      rises as a {@creature zombie}.
    - In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic
      mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand

        devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention

        with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on
        a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers
        an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature
        and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed
        on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@dice 20d6}) slashing damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    entries:
    - A mythallar looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The
      globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional
      300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various
      purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities
      aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic
      it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.
    - "The Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device\u2014a mere 50 feet in diameter.\
      \ To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30\
      \ feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned\
      \ to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement\
      \ rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to\
      \ the mythallar, nothing happens."
    - 'All creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is
      being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties,
      but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The
      Ythryn mythallar''s properties are as follows:'
    - type: list
      items:
      - While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can
        use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of
        30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn
        mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.
      - As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet
        of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or
        uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn
        mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its
        own.
      - You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the {@spell control weather} spell
        without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors.
        This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's
        casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell
        fails.

      name: Touching the Mythallar
      entries:
      - Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 22 Constitution
        saving throw, taking 180 ({@damage 20d10 + 70}) radiant damage on a failed
        save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage
        on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact
        or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).
