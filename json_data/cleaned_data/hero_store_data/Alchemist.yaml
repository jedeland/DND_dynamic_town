    - "An abracadabrus is an ornate, gemstone-studded wooden chest that weighs 25\
      \ pounds while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 1\xBD feet\
      \ on a side."
    - The chest has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch the closed lid
      of the chest and expend 1 of the chest's charges while naming one or more nonmagical
      objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of
      1 gp or less. The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they
      can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example,
      the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon
      of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured
      by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems
      and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.
    - The chest regains {@dice 1d20} expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's
      last charge is expended, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the chest loses its magic
      (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust.

    - Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that
      his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon
      that would be such a symbol.
    - 'Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved,
      the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid

      and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young
      dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon,
      which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed
      the axe on for many generations.
    - Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in
      a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed.

      - The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it.
        Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the
        creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven
        days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses
        its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes
        wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't
        be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse,
        such as a {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell remove curse} spell.

      - The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to

        to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.
    - type: entries
      name: Properties of the Pestle
      entries:
      - The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while
        you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink
        it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle
        is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
        it.
      - The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle,
        you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force
        damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily

        of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth
        10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that
        material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish
        a short or long rest.
      - You can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item
        brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB},
        and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make

      - As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you
        can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your
        action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding
        the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful
        for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in
        the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's
        hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate.
        Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can
        have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped
        organs-into separate piles.

        creature.
      - You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific
        destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated
        destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and
        vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky,
        with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images
        of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination.

    - This bag superficially resembles a {@item bag of holding} but is a feeding orifice
      for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes
      the orifice.
    - The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed
      inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured
      and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens
      when someone reaches inside it, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the creature
      is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try
      to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its
      action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful
      DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature
      that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.
    - Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such
      material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and
      spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and

      regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
    - If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and
      its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside
      out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before
      it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a
      number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1
      minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
    - Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item

      destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
      where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet

    entries:
    - The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and
      drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it
      contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites
      madness.
    - Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded
      in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example
      of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic
      he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.
    - Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to
      its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of
      later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases,
      made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages
      are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that
      the original text can't be divined.
    - Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence,
      animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever
      it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long
      enough.
    - A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to
      digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify
      the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand
      the lore already contained within.
    - Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature
      must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment
      changes to neutral evil.
    - The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work
      evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span
      of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If
      you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul.
      You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

        contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually
        when a new author adds pages to the tome.
      - If a {@creature solar} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice
        1d100} years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.
      - "A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase\

    - Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth
      of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold
      piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
    - With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope,
      or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a
      day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the
      coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve
      goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions
      don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece
      is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters
      of credit, or valuable goods.
    - One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners.
      A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
      rest in a poor inn.
    - One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers
      and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
    - In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in
      treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate
      from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and
      skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver
      pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
    - A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

      can't be {@condition poisoned} are immune to this magical effect.
    - The dancer must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and
      has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and other creatures
      have advantage on attack rolls against it. Each time it takes damage, the dancer
      can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. When

    - Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of
      ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards,
      but the rest have twenty-two.
    - Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and
      then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate
      the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise,
      as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw
      each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the
      chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own
      and take effect all at once.
    - Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or
      the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same
      card twice.

      name: A Question of Enmity
      entries:
      - Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity
        of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character
        should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking
        out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash
        with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront
        the devil itself.
    - In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone
      thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a
      dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer
      guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.

        during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect
        of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character
        to operate in a robotic state until freed.

    entries:
    - A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an
      elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of
      orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation
      orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth
      of special components, which are consumed.
    - A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has
      a solid outer shell. The orb detonates {@dice 1d100} hours after its creation,
      releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of
      how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as {@spell identify}
      and {@spell divination} can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode.
      An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
      Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.
    - A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent
      it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's
      opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used
      to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the
      container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time
      when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes {@dice 1d6} rounds later, unless
      it is returned to the container.
    - Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with
      a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed
      after one use.

        damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot
        weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure.
        Otherwise, the rules for {@hazard strong wind} apply, as detailed in chapter
        5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

    - A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence
      of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during
      the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily
      isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most
      dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be
      found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria
      and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects
      of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned}
      in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to
      0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead.
      A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased
      through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the
      duration or the price might vary accordingly.

    - Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth
      of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold
      piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
    - With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope,
      or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a
      day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the
      coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve
      goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions
      don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece
      is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters
      of credit, or valuable goods.
    - One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners.
      A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
      rest in a poor inn.
    - One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers
      and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
    - In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in
      treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate
      from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and
      skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver
      pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
    - A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

    - Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his
      time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest,
      he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own
      mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever
      coming about.
    - '{@creature Orcus|MTF}, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that
      would allow him to live on as a {@creature lich}. Beyond death, he became the
      greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed,
      Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his
      temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One,
      the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted
      Tower.'
    - Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself,
      or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever
      the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle
      that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one
      hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's
      will in the world.
    - The Eye of Vecna and the {@item Hand of Vecna} might be found together or separately.
      The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is
      a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
    - To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact
      into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there
      until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit
      for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
    - To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the
      press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and
      becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

    - Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his
      time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest,
      he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own
      mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever
      coming about.
    - '{@creature Orcus|MTF}, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that
      would allow him to live on as a {@creature lich}. Beyond death, he became the
      greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed,
      Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his
      temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One,
      the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted
      Tower.'
    - Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself,
      or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever
      the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle
      that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one
      hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's
      will in the world.
    - The {@item Eye of Vecna} and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately.
      The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is
      a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
    - To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact
      into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there
      until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit
      for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
    - To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the
      press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and
      becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

      extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material,
      not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up
      to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds,
      regardless of its contents.
    - Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting
      with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action.
      When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically
      on top.
    - The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object
      pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack
      is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns
      up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill
      forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.
      If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive
      for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
    - Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item bag

      items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one
      item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is
      sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The
      gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

    - This armor also has six pockets, each of which is an extradimensional space.
      Each pocket can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of

      on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material
      component.

      target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask.
      If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the
      saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released.
      The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask
      doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.
    - You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature
      the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for
      1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or
      give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but
      otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in
      accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
    - An {@spell identify} spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but
      the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly
      discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined
      randomly.

          the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted
          realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains
          and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors.
          Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks
          and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the
          endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.
        - A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani
          in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von
          Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness
          and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people
          in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and
          Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures
          of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we
          must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."
        - Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only
          the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it,
          you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.

    - Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth
      of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold
      piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
    - With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope,
      or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a
      day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the
      coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve
      goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions
      don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece
      is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters
      of credit, or valuable goods.
    - One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners.
      A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
      rest in a poor inn.
    - One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers
      and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
    - In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in
      treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate
      from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and
      skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver
      pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
    - A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

    - You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a
      solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole
      10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane,
      so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable
      hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
    - You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of
      the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures
      or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in
      it, the hole weighs next to nothing.
    - If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space
      can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the

      the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole
      can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
    - Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item

      destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
      where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet
      of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
      Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

    - When you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or

      becomes 25, if it isn't already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled

      the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.
    - Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration.
      When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the
      normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal {@dice
      3d8} slashing damage (instead of {@dice 1d8}), or {@dice 3d10} slashing damage
      (instead of {@dice 1d10}) when used with two hands.

      of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It tastes

    - '{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} has kept this item in his possession for over
      a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on
      the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring,
      which normal heat can''t melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially
      numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is
      attuned to this ring.'
    - The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that
      wears it (see "Sentient Magic Items" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
      If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone
      and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies
      and bring the wearer's doom.

          of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once
          the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless
          you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature
          in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.
        - 'You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17)

          be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability
          of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after
          a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same
          statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature
          is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison
          damage, and immunity to the following conditions: {@condition charmed},
          {@condition exhaustion}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed},
          {@condition petrified}, and {@condition poisoned}. The ice creature obeys
          only its creator''s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied
          space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after
          24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 ({@dice

        - You have {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have
          {@sense darkvision}, being attuned to the rapier increases the range of

        - You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
        - You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison

          That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become
          {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more,
          the creature is also {@condition unconscious} while {@condition poisoned}
          in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature
          uses its action to shake the creature awake.
        - While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces
          and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have

    entries:
    - Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth
      of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold
      piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
    - With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope,
      or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a
      day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the
      coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve
      goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions
      don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece
      is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters
      of credit, or valuable goods.
    - One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners.
      A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
      rest in a poor inn.
    - One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers
      and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
    - In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in
      treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate
      from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and
      skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver
      pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
    - A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

      24 hours.
    - Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull

          - You can use the tooth to cast dominate monster (DC 18). Once you use this
            property, it can't be used again until the next dawn. You smell strongly
            of burning sulfur.
        - - '17'
          - Why the Sky Screams (blue dragon fang)
          - 1 {@creature ancient blue dragon}

          - 1 {@creature tarrasque} (ignores you and your commands appears for {@dice
            1d4} rounds then vanishes)
          - You deal double damage to objects and structures. If you take 20 or more
            damage in one turn, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or
            spend your next turn in a murderous fury. During this rage, you must use
            your action to make an unarmed strike against a creature that damaged
            you, or a random creature you can see if you weren't damaged by a creature,
            moving as close as you can to the target if necessary.

          - You gain immunity to fire damage, and as an action, you can exhale fire
            in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity
            saving throw, taking {@damage 26d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half
            as much damage on a successful one. After using the breath weapon, you
            gain 2 levels of {@condition exhaustion}.
        - - '20'
          - Dahlver-Nar's Tooth (dusty human molar)
          - 1 {@creature priest}
          - As an action you can call on a divine force to come to your aid. Describe
            the assistance you seek, and the DM decides the nature of the intervention
            (the effect of any cleric spell would be appropriate). Once this property
            is used, it can't be used again for 7 days.

      name: Sowing Teeth
      entries:
      - To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within
        your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you
        in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing
        so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind,
        or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned
        column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown
        as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak,
        and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.
    - type: entries
      name: Implanting Teeth
      entries:
      - To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own
        teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your
        mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted
        Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth,
        and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your
        death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted
        at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total).
        If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of
        the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and
        you lose the implanted effect.
    - type: entries
      name: Recovering Teeth
      entries:
      - Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with
        all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different
        world of the Material Plane.
    - type: entries
      name: Destroying the Teeth
      entries:
      - Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the
        tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in
        this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some
        of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others
        act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

    name: The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad

    page: 96
    rarity: artifact
    reqAttune: true
    wondrous: true
    bonusWeaponAttack: '+1'
    entries:
    - This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten
      and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient
      and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins
      derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal
      Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.
    - Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought
      it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later
      years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with
      its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical
      effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known
      as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his
      great machine was destroyed.
    - The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing
      some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty
      levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These
      controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.
    - type: entries
      name: Silver Wire
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing
        use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its
        attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from
        the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature
        as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to
        the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire
        becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite
        length.
      - "As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of\
        \ the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user.\
        \ If the wire is cut\u2014something that can happen only when an effect specifically\
        \ states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord\u2014\
        the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them\
        \ instantly."
      - Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated
        on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of
        14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.

      - 'When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability

    - type: entries
      name: Wish
      entries:
      - The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the
        proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell
        (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming,
        this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used,
        there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning,
        necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the
        expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs
        are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.

      name: Random Properties
      entries:
      - "There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls\
        \ than can ever be known or matrixed\u2014especially as the controls shift\
        \ position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of\
        \ the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random\
        \ beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for\
        \ each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep\
        \ things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties,\
        \ revealing those properties only during the course of play."
      - Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long
        rest.

        \ catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery.\
        \ It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal\
        \ Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner\
        \ workings\u2014and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked.\
        \ Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine\
        \ to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space\

      - - '05'

          vanishes.
        - You grow a unicorn horn.
      - - '10'
        - A specialized clockwork compass floats in front of you. You can name one
          character, place, or object on the same plane as you and have the compass
          point constantly in the direction of the named target. You gain no knowledge
          of the distance to the target.
        - A specialized clockwork compass floats in front of you, and points toward
          you. The DM determines whether a creature currently looking for you is drawn
          to your location. Additionally, when a creature attacks you for the first
          time during an encounter, it has advantage on the attack roll.
      - - '11'
        - Your clothes are wrapped in illusion that makes them appear to be the very
          latest style, drawing praise and attention. You have a +1 bonus to Charisma

          On a failed save, you transfer the disease or the condition to the target,
          and the disease or condition ends for you.
        - Water becomes intensely acidic to you. If you are submerged in water, you
          take {@dice 1d6} acid damage at the start of each of your turns, and drinking

        - If you drop to 0 hit points, a phantom guardian appears next to you, functioning
          as if you had cast the {@spell Mordenkainen's faithful hound} spell. The
          guardian disappears if you die, regain hit points, or regain consciousness.
        - No one takes you seriously, imposing disadvantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}

          ({@skill Intimidation}) checks.
      - - '22'

        - All creatures you speak with automatically believe your words, as if you
          have succeeded on a Charisma ({@skill Deception} or {@skill Persuasion})
          check against them. Any sign of threatening or duplicitous action on your
          part negates this automatic success.
        - Your personal tastes reverse, such that your favorite foods, hobbies, music,
          and so forth become unbearable to you.
      - - '35'
        - Your shadow becomes an undead {@creature shadow} that shares your alignment

      - - '38'
        - Each time you finish a short rest, you suddenly sprout a covering of fragrant
          leaves. The leaves fall off after {@dice 1d10} minutes, revealing {@dice
          1d6} magic fruits that can be plucked from your head. Each fruit functions
          as a berry created with the {@spell goodberry} spell.
        - Whenever you stop moving for 10 minutes or more, you discover that your
          boots or shoes have set down roots that must be pulled free with a successful
          DC 20 Strength check.
      - - '39'
        - Choose a creature you can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity

      - - '40'
        - A group of small forest animals appears and follows you everywhere, singing

        - You break out into song whenever you roll a 1 on any die.
      - - '41'
        - Your possessions change their state or appearance at the DM's determination,
          giving you hints of potential future events. For example, your sword might
          become suddenly bloodstained to warn of an upcoming combat encounter, your

        The trap deals damage appropriate to the materials used in crafting it (such
        as poison or a weapon) or damage equal to half the total of your check, whichever
        the DM deems appropriate.

    source: ToA

    type: G
    rarity: none
    value: 1000
    entries:
    - Zabou mushrooms feed on offal and the rotting wood of dead trees. If handled
      carefully, a zabou can be picked or uprooted without causing it to release its
      spores. If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius
      sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade,
      releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed
      on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute.
      The {@condition poisoned} creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature
      can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
      on itself on a success.
